# Swendsen-Wang algorithm

This project is a C++ implementation of Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm for 2-D Ising model. In particular this is the solution to the second assignment for [P452: Computational Physics](https://www.niser.ac.in/sps/course/p452-computational-physics) course.

## How to run

Execute the file [run_swendsen.sh](run_swendsen.sh) and enter the parameters. The results will be stored in the [results](results/) folder.
